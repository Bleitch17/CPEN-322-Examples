This is a simple client server implementation for testing AJAX messages.
The server is written in Python (2 not 3), and you need to install Python to run it.

You can modify the server parameters by changing the corresponding variables in the Python file
The variable names are self-explanatory. Use this to test the error-handling and timeout
functions in your AJAX requests. 

If you want to contribute code to the server to make it easier to configure, please do so.
